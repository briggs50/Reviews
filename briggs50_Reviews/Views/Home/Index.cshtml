            <h3>Hidden Figures</h3>
            <p>
                The incredible untold story of Katherine G. Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson -
                brilliant African-American women working at NASA, who served as the brains behind one of
                the greatest operations in history: the launch of astronaut John Glenn into orbit, a stunning
                achievement that restored the nation's confidence, turned around the Space Race, and galvanized
                the world. The visionary trio crossed all gender and race lines to inspire generations to dream big.
